for loop: a for loop is a scripting loop that allows you to do a task over and over again for the amount of time given in the loop (until the conditions are met).

&& || !: && means and which conditions on both sides of the && need to be true for the code to run.  || is OR which means either or conditions on both sides of the || need to be true.  ! is the not statement which means that the condition on the other side of the ! needs to be false.

Array: thought as a storage container for different values.  

git: Open Source software that is used for version control. useful in collabration environments as it keeps changes from stepping over each other.

GitHub: Cloud service for version control and collabration.
